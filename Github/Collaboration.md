# Github Collaboration

## Public Vs. Private Repos
Public repos are accessible to everyone on the internet. Anyone can see the repo on Github.<br>
Private repos are only accessible to the owner and people who have been granted access.<br>
> **To change**: Settings -> Danger Zone

## Adding Collaborators
Settings -> Manage access

## README File
READMEs are Markdown files, ending with the .md extension.
It is used to communicate important information about a repo including:
+ What the project does
+ How to run the project
+ Why it's noteworthy
+ Who maintains the project

## Markdown
Markdown is a convenient syntax to generate formatted text.

## Github Gists
Github Gists are a simple way to share code snippets and useful fragments with others. Gists are much easier to create, but offer far fewer features than a typical Github repository.

## Github Pages
Github Pages are public webpages that are hosted and published via Github. They allow you to create a website simply by pushing your code to Github.<br>
Github Pages is a hosting service for **static** webpages, so it does not support server-side code like Python, Ruby, or Node. Just HTML/CSS/JS!
- User Site: You get one user site per Github account, following this pattern: **username.github.io**
- Project Sites: You get unlimited project sites, following this pattern: **username.github.io/repo-name**
